# Alvaro's Portfolio

## The Repository

This repository provides the landing page for my portfolio. In my portfolio I provide a brief description of who I am, and I intend to continuously post my projects and work.

Please click the link below to open the [My Portfolio](https://floressuarezalvaro.github.io/my_portfolio/). Since my page is responsive, I'll include two screenshots of my page for visibility. The first screenshot displays what it should look like on a small device such as your mobile device, and the second screenshot displays what it should look like on your larger screen.

## Contributing

The best way to participate in my portfolio is to [submit a bug](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/portfolio/issues). Additionally, you can review the [source code](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/portfolio/pulls) changes. Lastly, you can [build from the source itself](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/portfolio/wiki).

## Credits

I used Bootstrap throughout my porfolio. Please click [here](https://getbootstrap.com/) to visit the Bootstrap page. Here you'll find the same documentation I used to build my pages out.
